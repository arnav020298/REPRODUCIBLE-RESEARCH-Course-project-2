# Course5_Project1
This is for the first project in a Coursera course on reproducible research.

The files in here are comprised of:
1) A series of html images.
2) A series of .md intermediates.
3) Project1.Rmd - this file that contains code and information to set up the data import, processing, and analysis.
4) Project1.html - this file contains the output from knitting the document.

Note that the intstructions mentioned using knitr::knit2html(), but this function fails when using an Rmarkdown file v2.  Instead I have used rmarkdown::render().
